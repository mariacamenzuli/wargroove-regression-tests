# Wargroove Regression Tests

An automated test suite that uses computer vision to locate units, menu buttons, and all other components of the GUI. The test setup navigates from the main menu to a custom test scenario, then finds and right clicks each unit to open up its information panel and verify that the correct movement information (walk 4, fly 8, etc) is displayed. The test tear down closes the scenario and navigates back to the main menu.

Developed as part of an MSc project, titled Applying Visual GUI Testing to Computer Game Testing.
